# Team Agreement

## Communication plan:  
  - Our main communication is Slack and if that fails then phone message. 
  - Work during the day time. 
  - Try to get things done between the class time. 
  - If urgent, then maybe work extra on the project.

## Conflict plan: 
  - If there is conflict between two, try to address within the group. 
  - If that doesn't resolve the problem then talk to the TA. Final resolution would be Amanda.

## Work plan: 
  - Meet in morning. 
  - Have group discussion about things to be done 
  - Break into pair programming partners, or work individually.

## Git process: 
  - Github is our source control. 
  - Master is going to be reviewed by two people being merged to the master. 
  - Flow will be `test` branch -> `development` branch -> and lastly `master` branch. 
  - Testing is our default branch. Branch off from testing, and merge it to the testing branch at the end of the day.

## Any thing else you feel is important:
  - No longer than 1 hour and a half to take a break. 
  - Have lunch around noon to 1 pm.
