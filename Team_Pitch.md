# Pitch:
A side scrolling 2D game, 
where our character is a "student" who is trying to make it to the end of the level and go to class. 
He faces many obstacles along the way and must overcome bug and platforming to reach his goal. 
Player will have three lives and start at the starting point once they die. This will be created using Unity.   
*(Amanda Approved)*

The game's aim to solve boredom in our quarantine lives and be able to go through hardship that students go 
through during Code Fellows and present that in this game.

## MVP:
1. One level with a character that can go through 
2. Being able to go up right left and down. 
3. Platforms and obstacles
4. Blue screen at the end.
5. Sound.
6. Sneaky admin to finish the game immediately

## Stretch Goals:
1. Creating boss that is Code challenge (Smiley face)
2. Adding collectibles(coins, codes)
3. Different Levels
4. Power ups
5. Hidden Octopus
6. Different character depending on languages (make java the weakest, css)
